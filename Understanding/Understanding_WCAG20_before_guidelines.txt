    Abstract

This document, "Understanding WCAG 2.0," is an essential guide to
understanding and using Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0
<http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/> [WCAG20] <#WCAG20>. It is part of a
series of documents that support WCAG 2.0. Please note that the contents
of this document are informative (they provide guidance), and not
normative (they do not set requirements for conforming to WCAG 2.0). See
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php> for an introduction to WCAG,
supporting technical documents, and educational material.

WCAG 2.0 establishes a set of Success Criteria to define conformance to
the WCAG 2.0 Guidelines. A Success Criterion is a testable statement
that will be either true or false when applied to specific Web content.
"Understanding WCAG 2.0" provides detailed information about each
Success Criterion, including its intent, the key terms that are used in
the Success Criterion, and how the Success Criteria in WCAG 2.0 help
people with different types of disabilities. This document also provides
examples of Web content that meet the success criterion using various
Web technologies (for instance, HTML, CSS, XML), and common examples of
Web content that does not meet the success criterion.

This document indicates specific techniques to meet each Success
Criterion. Details for how to implement each technique are available in
Techniques for WCAG 2.0 <http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/>, but
"Understanding WCAG 2.0" provides the information about the relationship
of each technique to the Success Criteria. Techniques are categorized by
the level of support they provide for the Success Criteria. "Sufficient
techniques" are /sufficient/ to meet a particular Success Criterion
(either by themselves or in combination with other techniques), while
other techniques are advisory and therefore optional. None of the
techniques are /required/ to meet WCAG 2.0, although some may be the
only known method if a particular technology is used. "Advisory
techniques" are not sufficient to meet the Success Criteria on their own
(because they are not testable or provide incomplete support) but it is
encouraged that authors follow them when possible to provide enhanced
accessibility. Another support category is "Common Failures", which
describe authoring practices known to cause Web content /not/ to conform
to WCAG 2.0. Although failures provide advisory information about
certain authoring practices, authors must avoid those practices in order
to meet the WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria.

This document is part of a series of documents published by the W3C Web
Accessibility Initiative (WAI) to support WCAG 2.0. This document was
published as a Working Group Note at the same time WCAG 2.0 was
published as a W3C Recommendation. Unlike WCAG 2.0, is expected that the
information in Understanding WCAG 2.0 will be updated from time to time.

This is a Working Group Note "Understanding WCAG 2.0". The Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines Working Group <http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/>
considers this document to be important for understanding the success
criteria in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0
Recommendation <http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/>. Please
note that the contents of this document are informative (they provide
guidance), and not normative (they do not set requirements for
conforming to WCAG 2.0).

Understanding WCAG 2.0 was previously published on 11 December 2008
<http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/> as a Working Group Note and
updated 14 October 2010. This new version updates the support
information provided for WCAG 2.0. Note that WCAG 2.0 itself remains
unchanged, only the informative support materials have been updated.
Primary changes include addition of PDF and Silverlight techniques, and
clarifications based on input from the public and translators. The
changes are highlighted in the diff-marked version
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/NOTE-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20120103/complete-diff>.

    Introduction to Understanding WCAG 2.0

Understanding WCAG 2.0 is an essential guide to understanding and using
"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0" [WCAG20] <#WCAG20> Although
the normative definition and requirements for WCAG 2.0 can all be found
in the WCAG 2.0 document itself, the concepts and provisions may be new
to some people. Understanding WCAG 2.0 provides a non-normative extended
commentary on each guideline and each Success Criterion to help readers
better understand the intent and how the guidelines and Success Criteria
work together. It also provides examples of techniques or combinations
of techniques that the Working Group has identified as being sufficient
to meet each Success Criterion. Links are then provided to write-ups for
each of the techniques.

This is not an introductory document. It is a detailed technical
description of the guidelines and their Success Criteria. See Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php> for an introduction to WCAG,
supporting technical documents, and educational material.

Understanding WCAG 2.0 is organized by guideline. There is an
/Understanding Guideline X.X/ section for each guideline. The intent and
any advisory techniques that are related to the guideline but not
specifically related to any of its Success Criteria are listed there as
well.

The /Understanding Guidelines X.X/ section is then followed by a
/Understanding Success Criterion X.X.X/ section for each Success
Criterion of that guideline. These sections each contain:

  *

    The Success Criterion as it appears in WCAG 2.0

  *

    Intent of the Success Criterion

  *

    Benefits (how the Success Criterion helps people with disabilities)

  *

    Examples

  *

    Related Resources

  *

    Techniques or combinations of techniques that are sufficient to meet
    the guidelines

  *

    Common failures of this Success Criterion

  *

    Additional advisory techniques that go beyond what is required to
    meet the Success Criterion but can be used to make some or all types
    of content more accessible. Use of advisory techniques does not
    impact the level of conformance claimed.

  *

    Key terms for this Success Criterion (taken from the WCAG 2.0 Glossary)

Links are provided from each Guideline in WCAG 2.0 directly to each
/Understanding Guideline X.X/ in this document. Similarly, there is a
link from each Success Criterion in WCAG 2.0 to the /Understanding
Success Criterion X.X.X/ section in this document.

For information about individual techniques, follow the links throughout
this document to the techniques of interest in the Techniques for WCAG
2.0 <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/> document.

For links to information on different disabilities and assistive
technologies see Disabilities on Wikipedia
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disabilities>.


      Understanding the Four Principles of Accessibility

The guidelines and Success Criteria are organized around the following
four principles, which lay the foundation necessary for anyone to access
and use Web content. Anyone who wants to use the Web must have content
that is:

 1.

    Perceivable - Information and user interface components must be
    presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

      *

        This means that users must be able to perceive the information
        being presented (it can't be invisible to all of their senses)

 2.

    Operable - User interface components and navigation must be operable.

      *

        This means that users must be able to operate the interface (the
        interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform)

 3.

    Understandable - Information and the operation of user interface
    must be understandable.

      *

        This means that users must be able to understand the information
        as well as the operation of the user interface (the content or
        operation cannot be beyond their understanding)

 4.

    Robust - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted
    reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive
    technologies.

      *

        This means that users must be able to access the content as
        technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve,
        the content should remain accessible)

If any of these are not true, users with disabilities will not be able
to use the Web.

Under each of the principles are guidelines and Success Criteria that
help to address these principles for people with disabilities. There are
many general usability guidelines that make content more usable by all
people, including those with disabilities. However, in WCAG 2.0, we only
include those guidelines that address problems particular to people with
disabilities. This includes issues that block access or interfere with
access to the Web more severely for people with disabilities.


      Layers of Guidance


        The Guidelines

Under each principle there is a list of guidelines that address the
principle. There are a total of 12 guidelines. A convenient list of just
the guidelines can be found in the WCAG 2.0 table of contents
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#contents>. One of the
key objectives of the guidelines is to ensure that content is directly
accessible to as many people as possible, and capable of being
re-presented in different forms to match different peoples' sensory,
physical and cognitive abilities.


        Success Criteria

Under each guideline, there are Success Criteria that describe
specifically what must be achieved in order to conform
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#conformancedef> to this
standard. They are similar to the "checkpoints" in WCAG 1.0. Each
Success Criterion is written as a statement that will be either true or
false when specific Web content is tested against it. The Success
Criteria are written to be technology neutral.

All WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria are written as testable criteria for
objectively determining if content satisfies the Success Criteria. While
some of the testing can be automated using software evaluation programs,
others require human testers for part or all of the test.

Although content may satisfy the Success Criteria, the content may not
always be usable by people with a wide variety of disabilities.
Professional reviews utilizing recognized qualitative heuristics are
important in achieving accessibility for some audiences. In addition,
usability testing is recommended. Usability testing aims to determine
how well people can use the content for its intended purpose.

The content should be tested by those who understand how people with
different types of disabilities use the Web. It is recommended that
users with disabilities be included in test groups when performing human
testing.

Each Success Criterion for a guideline has a link to the section of the
How to Meet document that provides:

  *

    sufficient techniques for meeting the Success Criterion,

  *

    optional advisory techniques, and

  *

    descriptions of the intent of the Success Criteria, including
    benefits, and examples.


        Sufficient and Advisory Techniques

Rather than having technology specific techniques in WCAG 2.0, the
guidelines and Success Criteria themselves have been written in a
technology neutral fashion. In order to provide guidance and examples
for meeting the guidelines using specific technologies (for example
HTML) the working group has identified */sufficient techniques/* for
each Success Criterion that are sufficient to meet that Success
Criterion. Sufficient techniques are provided in a numbered list where
each list item provides the technique or combination of techniques that
can be used to meet the Success Criterion. When there are multiple
techniques on a numbered list item connected by "AND" then all of the
techniques must be used. For example, Situation B in Understanding
Success Criterion 2.2.1 lists as the third sufficient technique: SCR16:
Providing a script that warns the user a time limit is about to expire
(Scripting) AND SCR1: Allowing the user to extend the default time limit
(Scripting).

The list of sufficient techniques is maintained in the "Understanding
WCAG 2.0" (and mirrored in How to Meet WCAG 2.0). The Introduction to
Techniques for WCAG 2.0
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20120103/intro.html#intro-tech-types>
lists technologies for which there are currently any sufficient
techniques. By separating the WCAG 2 normative guidelines document from
the techniques used to meet the success criteria in those guidelines it
is possible to update the list as new techniques are discovered, and as
Web Technologies and Assistive Technologies progress.

Note that all techniques are informative
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#informativedef>. The
"sufficient techniques" are considered sufficient by the WCAG Working
Group to meet the success criteria. However, it is not necessary to use
these particular techniques. If techniques are used other than those
listed by the Working Group, then some other method for establishing the
technique's ability to meet the Success Criteria would be needed.

Most Success Criteria have multiple sufficient techniques listed. Any of
the listed sufficient techniques can be used to meet the Success
Criterion. There may be other techniques which are not documented by the
working group that could also meet the Success Criterion. As new
sufficient techniques are identified they will be added to the listing.

In addition to the sufficient techniques, there are a number of
*/advisory techniques/* that can enhance accessibility, but did not
qualify as sufficient techniques because they are not sufficient to meet
the full requirements of the Success Criteria, they are not testable,
and/or because they are good and effective techniques in some
circumstances but not effective or helpful in others. These are listed
as advisory techniques and are right below the sufficient techniques.
Authors are encouraged to use these techniques wherever appropriate to
increase accessibility of their Web pages.

/Note: /Code examples found in the sufficient techniques are intended to
demonstrate the principle discussed in the description of the technique.
The code is not intended to demonstrate other aspects of accessibility,
usability or best coding practices not related to the technique.
